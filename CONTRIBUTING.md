# Semantic Versioning
To make sure you're using the most recent design files, check out [our releases](https://github.com/make4covid/face-shield/releases) and download the latest version!

This repo uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
* `v1.4.12` means "Major Version: 1, Minor Version: 4, Patch Version: 12"
* Files from the same major version are compatible.
* Files from different major versions (e.g. `v1.x.y` and `v2.x.y`) might not be compatible
* Use the latest version files. They're better and safer.
* If you find an exception (in compatibility or quality), please [open an issue.](https://github.com/make4covid/face-shield/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=design-issue-template.md&title=)
* These designs are mostly stable, so don't expect a new major version.
