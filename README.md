# Semantic Versioning
**Any version of these designs below v1.0 (including pre-release) have not been validated and are not considered safe to use in a clinical setting.**

We regularly update and improve our designs. To make sure you're using the most recent design files, check out [our releases](https://github.com/make4covid/face-shield/releases) and download the latest version if you don't have it already!

This design repository uses semantic versioning, which has the format of `v\<Major Version>.\<Minor Version>`. So `v2.1` has a Major Version of 2 and a Minor Version of 1.

A change in the Major Version means that changes may not be backwards compatible. So a shield with version `1.x` may not fit the pegs of a headband with version `v2.y`, but a `v2.z` shield will fit a `2.y` headband. 

A change in the minor version may impact the safety profile, the quality of the print, or other things, but shouldn't have an effect on compatibility. So it's better to use `v1.1` than `v1.0`, but the two versions should be interchangable in terms of fit.

If you're using the recommended materials for each design, then a shield cut from a `v1.x` file should fit on any `v1.y` RC1, RC2, or RC3 headband. If you find a problem with the design, compatible, please [open an issue!](https://github.com/make4covid/face-shield/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=design-issue-template.md&title=)

## Releasing New Versions
This repository's benevolent dictators can [release new versions here](https://github.com/make4covid/face-shield/releases) once changes have been validated. Simply click `Draft New Release` and provide an incremented version number, along with a description of the changes made for that version. For changes that impact component compatibility, such as a change in peg positions, increment the major version. For all other changes (e.g. `v1.5` -> `v2.0`), increment the minor version (e.g. `1.3` -> `1.4`).

If a release hasn't been fully validated, you can mark it as a `pre-release`, which you can update once validation is complete.

# Issues?
If you find a problem with a design, compatibility between files, safety, documentation, or suggestions for improvement, please [open an issue!](https://github.com/make4covid/face-shield/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=design-issue-template.md&title=)

Alternatively, you can [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo), make the change yourself, and request to merge it in. If it's a good change, we'll merge it in, although we may ask for changes to your request, or we may make some changes ourselves.
