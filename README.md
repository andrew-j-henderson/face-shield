This repo contains the face shield currently in production by the Make4Covid
organization. The Make4Covid design is based on [this design from Prusa](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/25857-prusa-protective-face-shield-rc3).

# Github for _hardware?_
It's not unheard of. Here are some things to keep in mind.
* Diffs don't mean much on binary files, so don't worry about them.
* Github _can_ show visual diffs on `.stl` files, so it's helpful to include them in addition to other CAD file types.
* Merging is also a challenge with binaries. Replace whole files or coordinate to avoid merge conflicts.
* Hardware repos can get huge, but you don't have to clone down everything to contribute.
* If the repo gets too big, we can set up `git lfs` (large file storage) to trim it down.

If you have other ideas on how to optimize git for open-source hardware, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/make4covid/face-shield/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=design-issue-template.md&title=) to let us know!
